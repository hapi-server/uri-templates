This version of the URI_Templates library provides support to JavaScript and NodeJS.  It was created
using ____*.

*It seems like https://www.jsweet.org/jsweet-live-sandbox was used, but it is uncertain.  Whatever automated system was used, a good amount of additional work was needed, perhaps to remove the javaemul.internal.StringHelper use to get sprintf.

# Method
This is a translation of the Java version of the library.  Much like with the creation of the Python version of the library,
a translator is used to do the bulk of the work.  This was appearently jsweet back in early 2022, but the Java-to-Python
converter could also be modified and give an improved result.  (JSweet tries to make a 100% working code at a cost of readability,
and we want more of a 90% working code which is more readable and must be finished by a human.)
