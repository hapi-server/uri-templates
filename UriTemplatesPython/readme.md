Python TimeUtil.py was created using a Java AST parser and formatting the 
Java AST into a Python code.  The goal is to make a conversion process which
can be done within a couple of hours.  

The website https://jfaden.net/JavaJythonConverter/ConvertServlet was used
to do the conversion, and then a bit of human time and unit testing is needed
beyond that.

Note this may change as it is finalized.
